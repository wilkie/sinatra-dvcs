# Easy Code Hosting with Sinatra

This project demonstrates the most basic means of read-only web serving of both git and mercurial repositories. Just run 'rackup' like any other sinatra app, and it will serve all repositories out of the 'repos' directory.

You can easily add these routes to your sinatra app or middleware to support git/mercurial repository pulling.
